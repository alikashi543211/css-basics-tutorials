## 🎨 What is CSS?

CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is used to style and design HTML elements. Think of HTML as the structure of a house and CSS as the paint and decoration that make it attractive and welcoming.

Just like no one is impressed by a plain cement structure, a plain HTML website is also not appealing. CSS adds life and beauty to your web pages.

## 🛠️ How to Use CSS?

There are **three main ways** to use CSS in a webpage:

1. **Inline CSS** – For small, one-line styles (not recommended for larger projects)
2. **Internal CSS** – CSS inside the `<style>` tag in the HTML `<head>`
3. **External CSS** – Best practice for large projects using separate `.css` files
